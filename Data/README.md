#Sample data Files

1. [A small handful of events](./gntp.NuMI_C12_dilepton_inclusive.root), as they come out from the tweaked [event generator](../src/gNuMIExptEvGen.cxx).
2. [Preprocesses events](./ultralisk_until7.gst.root), with added dilepton invariant mass and number-of-muons in final state branches.
3. [GST Tree Branches definition](./GST Tree Branches definition.pdf), which has been extracted from GENIE Physics and User Manual_v2.10.00a. This explains the meaning of the branches in our data files.
4. [pdg particles codes] (./montecarlorpp.pdf), codes about particles that we need identify.
